# Improvised Dark Mode for DSA5/TDE5

Feel free to contribute!

This is an inofficial implementation of a dark mode skin for the foundry vtt The Dark Eye game system.

To activate install the module and select the dark mode skin in the TDE/DSA game settings.
Make sure to set foundry to dark mode too.

THIS IS IN NO WAY A REAL DARKMODE, IF YOU WANT THIS TO HAPPEN - ADD PULL REQUESTS


You can also take this repository as an example on how to create skins for TDE/DSA
